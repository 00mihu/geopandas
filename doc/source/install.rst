Installing GeoPandas
---------------------

To install the released version, you can use pip::

or you can install the conda package from the conda-forge channel::

    conda install -c conda-forge geopandas

You may install the latest development version by cloning the
`GitHub` repository and using the setup script::

    git clone https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas.git
    cd geopandas
    pip install .

It is also possible to install the latest development version
available on PyPI with `pip` by adding the ``--pre`` flag for pip 1.4
and later, or to use `pip` to install directly from the GitHub
repository with::
